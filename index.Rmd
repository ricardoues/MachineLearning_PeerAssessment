```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(dplyr)

training <- read.csv(file="pml-training.csv")

testing <- read.csv(file="pml-testing.csv")

```

## Executive summary


```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

missing.summary <- sapply(testing, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) 

indexs <- sapply(testing, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) > 0 



```


## Exploratory analysis and preprocessing 

The training set has 160 variables. The first variable represents a correlative number. The variables user_name, raw_timestamp_part_1,  raw_timestamp_part_2 and cvtd_timestamp will not be taken into account in the modelling. 

The training set has missing data.
